# Past-and-Future-climate-data-classification
Working on clustering 30 years of past and future typical climate data to create climate zones. After cleaning and analyzing the data, I apply clustering techniques to group regions. These zones will be merged with extreme climate data, and the findings will be documented in a research paper.
