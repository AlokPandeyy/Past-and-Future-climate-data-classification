# Past-and-Future-climate-data-classification
Working on clustering 30 years of past and future typical climate data to create climate zones. After cleaning and analyzing the data, I apply clustering techniques to group regions. These zones will be merged with extreme climate data, and the findings will be documented in a research paper.



Climate Zoning Using Soft Clustering (Pan-India)

In this project, I worked on clustering 4790 locations across India into different climate zones using typical weather data from the past 30 years and future projections. The idea was to group similar regions based on their seasonal weather patterns.



What I Did
	•	Cleaned and prepared 30 years of past and future climate data
	•	Used Fuzzy C-Means for soft clustering to assign membership levels to each zone
	•	Tried other models like K-Means and DBSCAN, but soft clustering gave better insights
	•	Evaluated each cluster’s properties like temperature and humidity ranges
	•	Merged typical climate data with extreme weather data to build a more complete zoning system
	•	Preparing a research paper based on the final results



Why This Project

Understanding how climate zones may shift in the future is important for urban planning, agriculture, and building energy-efficient infrastructure. This project helps capture both average conditions and extreme events in the zoning process.
